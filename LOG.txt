    - Extensively explored on how to send file from Angular to python
    - Discarded the idea of php as it is not possible
    - Came up with two more solution
        - Using ngx-csv-parser package to read the csv file and create an object,
        - then write the object to a new csv file using ngx-csv package
        - and communicate the location of csv file written to python
        - Another solution is to just pass the csv file content as object from Angular to python in a POST request
        - and then convert that object recieved in python to a pandas dataframe
    - Implemented the solution of ngx-csv-parser and ngx-csv
    - Modified Python code to predict using given dynamic values from front end
    - Added some more validations to the front end
    - Added screenshots to the document
